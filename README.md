This study presents a method for Short-term Load Forecasting (STLF) that combines Light
Gradient Boosting Machines (LGBM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) in an ensemble model. The
combination of sequential learning exhibited by GRU and the ensemble power of LGBM outperforms
traditional approaches, which are frequently inadequate in capturing complicated load patterns. Seasonality,
weather, and load patterns are all taken into account while training the model using historical load data.
The better forecasting accuracy of the ensemble GRU-LGBM is demonstrated by real-world dataset results,
offering a reliable solution for dynamic load fluctuations. This study advances STLF approaches by providing
a flexible framework for the best grid management
